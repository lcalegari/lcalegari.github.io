            Hi, I'm a current Junior at Northwestern University studying Computer Science. I'm interested in back-end programming, and have experience with it through a Software Engineering Internship I did over Summer 2022 where I updated and added additional features to a back-end services. I also have experience with data analysis, as I worked in a neuroscience lab from August 2020-March 2021 and wrote python scripts to analyze survey data for them. I have also done a variety of personal projects. My strongest languages are C#, python, C++, C, and Javascript. I also have experience with Java and Solidity. Additionally, I have a lot of experience with HTML, CSS, JSON, XML, Visual Studio, Object-Oriented Programming, agile software development and SCRUM (which I practiced at my internship), and blockchain programming.
